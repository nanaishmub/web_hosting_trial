    <h3>About Free Guy</h3>
    <p class="content">
      When a bank teller discovers he's actually a background player in an open-world video game, he decides to become the hero of his own story -- one that he can rewrite himself. In a world where there's no limits, he's determined to save the day his way before it's too late, and maybe find a little romance with the coder who conceived him.

    <h3>My Experience in the Video-game World </h3>
    <p class="content">
      This movie is forever carved in my memories. When you first see this movie you're like, "Oh, it's a video game movie." But once you've watched it from beginning to end you'll be more like, "OHH!!! IT'S A VIDEO GAME MOVIE!!!" 
      Guy is such a captivating character who shows that anything is possible. His adventures in Free City are by far one of my favourite.
